 * A quieter ripple than the Material default, applied app-wide.

 * Material 3's own alphas are tuned for light surfaces; on the near-black background this app
 * uses they read as a grey flash rather than a touch response. Each value is roughly 40% of
 * the default — enough to register the touch, not enough to wash the surface.
 *
 * The colour is left unspecified on purpose, so the ripple keeps deriving from LocalContentColor
 * and stays correct inside [ForceDarkContent] subtrees, which run a different scheme.
 *
 * This reaches bare `Modifier.clickable` too, not just Material components: MaterialTheme
 * already provides `material3.ripple()` as LocalIndication, and that is the one indication that
 * reads this configuration. Nothing extra has to be provided for it.
 *
 * The (color, rippleAlpha) constructor is deprecated in favour of one that also takes a `focus`,
 * but that three-argument version is internal to material3, and the two public replacements —
 * (color) and (focus, color) — drop rippleAlpha entirely. Adjusting ripple alpha therefore has
 * no non-deprecated path in this version, so the warning is suppressed rather than designed
 * around. Revisit once material3 opens up the full constructor.
